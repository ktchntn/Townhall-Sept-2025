Recently, she has been tackling multiple complicated projects and she's taken it all in stride while keeping organized, calm and unwavering in level of craft. She has become one of our top 'go tos' on the team when we really want to push design and, as a result of that, has been setting the bar for all AT&T work.
                                <br><br>Erica is so down to earth, humble and driven. She's honest and realistic in her design approach and the way she deals with team members. She inspires our team by incrementally raising the bar on our design craft with each project and she's driven to create the best work she can - never settling for less than what it should be and continuing to push a client that doesn't always like to be pushed.
                                <br><br>As mentioned, Erica has continued to push our design fidelity on the AT&T account. This, in turn, has had a ripple effect across our team as they see the bar she's setting and are eager to work with her. (she's easily the most requested designer on our team)</p>

                                <br><br>Kim truly embodies all of CM's values. She's always the brightest person in the room, making everyone laugh and feel included. One of her best qualities is honesty, I completely trust her as my lead. Since she moved over to the ABS account, she's inspired us and brought us new ways of working. Her drive and dedication makes her a valuable asset to the team.
                                <br><br>Kim's 100% inspired and driven. No other way to rationalize how she's accomplished as much as she has despite being short handed. She's also as honest as it gets. You know exactly where she's at and it makes it easy to help navigate client requests. And despite the workload, she's very resilient in terms of still adhering to the disciplines and rigor of data science to ensure accuracy and expertise.</p>

                                <br><br>Jenny hits on all of these every day. I don't think she's even capable of lying and she listens to EVERYONE... no matter how good or bad their idea or question is. Jenny listens, acknowledges and addresses it. It's an incredible skill.</p>

She is super efficient, productive, and always just cary’s on to get the job done. Even when you don’t ask for help, she already knows what’s needed to be done and has done it before you can get to it. Lindsay has taken on an extra workload within her role, but it hasn’t stopped her from putting in the attention and effort to the Calgary office to make sure she’s part of maintaining office culture and making the people happy. With her approachable attitude, and keenness, nothing gets by her or is left unfinished.</p>
